# terminal
Terminal clone on web page

Hi! Please check those cool vanilla JS examples.

1) Menu just open index.html file - I was experimenting with default CSS nesting

2) Search bar is also available through file open

3) Terminal - for terminal I have used js module so pleas open it with live server or something similar
